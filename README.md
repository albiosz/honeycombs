# üêù Honeycombs 

Honeycombs is a web-based board game assistant that automates score tracking for the game **Honeycombs**.  
This project is an opportunity for me to showcase my skills in **backend development, REST API design, security**.

# üöÄ Why this project?

I built this application because:
- I love playing **Honeycombs** but found scoring to be tedious.
- It‚Äôs a great opportunity to apply **Java 21, Spring, PostgreSQL, and Docker**.
- I want to improve my skills in **REST API development, authentication, and cloud deployment**.
- I want to explore **Spring Boot** more deeply because of its **rich ecosystem, rapid development capabilities, and built-in security**.

# üöß Project Status
- [x] Database schema **designed and implemented** using **Spring Data JPA**
- [x] User authentication with **JWT + Spring Security**  
- [x] API is documented with **Swagger**  
- [x] Containerized with **Docker**

üîú Upcoming Features:
- [ ] Full **game rules & scoring logic**.
- [ ] **Frontend UI** to visualize and interact with the game.
- [ ] Deployment to a **cloud provider**.

It is possible to play with the API using Interactive Swagger Documentation (instruction below - [How to run?](README.md#how-to-run))
